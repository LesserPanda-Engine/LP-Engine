# LesserPanda HTML5 game engine

A fork of [Panda.js engine](http://www.pandajs.net) version 1.x.

## Why

I am using panda.js-engine for all of my recent projects, but its
v2 version currently does not support WebGL which is very important
for me to guarantee the performance on mobile devices.

So I decide to keep using Pixi.js(and switch to the latest v3) for rendering.

## Note

It uses a customed version of Pixi.js without "mesh" and "filters".
